If you use pharokka, I would recommend a citation in your manuscript along the lines of:

* All phages were annotated with Pharokka v ___ (Bouras, et al. 2023). Specifically, coding sequences (CDS) were predicted with PHANOTATE (McNair, et al. 2019), tRNAs were predicted with tRNAscan-SE 2.0 (Chan, et al. 2021), tmRNAs were predicted with Aragorn (Laslett, et al. 2004) and CRISPRs were preducted with CRT (Bland, et al. 2007). Functional annotation was generated by matching each CDS to the PHROGs (Terzian, et al. 2021), VFDB (Chen, et al. 2005) and CARD (Alcock, et al. 2020) databases using MMseqs2 (Steinegger, et al. 2017) and PyHMMER (Larralde and Zeller 2023). Contigs were matched to their closest hit in the INPHARED database (Cook, et al. 2021) using mash (Ondov, et al. 2016). Plots were created with pyCirclize (Shimoyama 2022).
